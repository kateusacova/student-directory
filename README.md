# student-directory
This is a guided tutorial facilitated by Makers.

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy :supervillain_woman:

## How to use

To run the script type the following in your terminal command line:
```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

To run the script and load the data from the existing file use:
***The data can only be loaded from the csv file.***
```shell
ruby directory.rb your_file.csv
```

## Exercises

The project also involves the set of exercises which was completed without guidance.

See "Exercise" commits to check how I refactored the code and solved various problems.

## Short program

short_program.rb is the last problem in the set of exercises.

This script reads its own source code and prints it on the screen.

To run the script type the following in your terminal command line:
```shell
ruby short_program.rb
```
