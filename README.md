# student-directory
This is a guided tutorial facilitated by Makers.

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy :supervillain_woman:

## How to use

To start the program type the following in your terminal command line:
```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

To start the program and load the data from the existing file use:
```shell
ruby directory.rb your_file.rb
```

## Exercises

The project also involves the set of exercises which was completed without guidance.

See "Exercise" commits to check how I refactored the code and solved various problems.

## Short program

short_program.rb is the last problem in the set of exercises.

This script reads its own source code and prints it on the screen.
